How do you deal with stress?

- Maybe you don't deal with it at all. (screaming into a pillow)
- Maybe you're one of those hot Yoga teachers (calm and zen)
- Personally I like to punch children.
- For me it's about being pro-active with my mental health.

Tekken

- I started playing Tekken 7 earlier in 2020.
- It's the first serious fighting game that I've played which actually clicked for me.
- Smash bros doesn't count.
- Actually, come to think of it Mortal Kombat I was playing before. (but this is the first online fighter I've played)
- If you love competition and the mindgame meta, you'll love Tekken.
- And if you don't like Tekken, then clearly it means you're a Trump supporter, and we'll probably have to brutal S&M sex later.

"Hey Julius. I'm an asexual male so I'm completely about dicks n' vaginas and stuff. As a result, the other kids at school tease me \
for not getting it. Could you please teach me what I should look for in women, if I were a normal straight male?"

- Firstly, it's all about breasts. If you see a chick with huge tits, you should be drooling. Public is totally okay in that situation.
- Although the proper answer is that you should be looking for emotionally hampered asian women.
- They're the most prized of all the women. Preferrably find one in cosplay, that's usually what we're looking for.
- So that way you can continue to have sex with her, and she'll be completely indifferent to how much of a creep you.
- As per usual, babe magnet reade dishing out solid advice.

Standing Desk

- Sitting is the new smoking, ya hear.
- For maybe the past 2 years I've been using a standing desk at home and at work.
- It's great! (talk about benefits, more energy, better back)
- Especially for sex work. Rather than bending down, you can just put your client on top of the desk and begin sucking that way. (it's a win/win)
- Like anything, you just adjust to it.

"I've been a celibate nun since I was a very small child. However, ever since visiting my first online porn website, I've realised that I actually want to become a slut. \
Are you able to teach me to be a slut?"

- The most important thing about being a slut is getting an STD. So basically, stop showering. Begin scraping your vagina on public toliet seats. (do what you can)
- Sex with questionable men is also important. Extra brownie points if you're also on drugs while having sex with that person.
- Outright disrespecting consent. If he/she or it says no, just ignore it, down a shot and go crazy.
- Perhaps most important, spitting on and both fucking other sluts is quality slut behaviour.

- As any sane person knows, reality TV is the foundation of western society. So you really should be binge watching that.
- Most porn thankfully is in English as well, so that's good. Which means you're also staying away from that wierd Japanese porn shit, which is also good for your soul.
