Drug Dealers

- Just a disclaimer, I've never been a drug dealer.
- I mean, you know. If a friend's around there might be some sharing.
- I don't know what it is, but drug dealers are the worst (describe guy from Burwood)
- (discuss drug dealer terms - homework, pizza etc.)
- They were basically people you had to be friends with, but no one ever liked.

"Hey Julius. Lovin' the show. I just creampied my own mother. Do you have any tips on dealing with the shame of having just partaken in mother-son incest?"

- Well, Alyssa I find the best way to deal with these situations is to just take a long cold shower. (play shower sound effect)
- Don't forget to clean down there. No one likes a cum-enrusted pussy. And it also shows to your mother that you really care about her.
- Of course, at this point, there really is only one solution, and that's to kill yourself.
- Die you incest scum. (play violent sound effects)
- And if you also happened to film it as well, please send it to thewritersdailypodcast@gmail.com

- Well unfortunately Asians are notoriously racist and you being Indian ...well, you might have to go white.
- Or Yellow face (which has been proven to be notoriously difficult compared to white face). Dried cat's piss works well for that.
- The main however, is having a lot of money. Asians love money.
- Being judgemental against them, is for whatever reason as sign of endearment for asian women. Just ask my mother.
- They also like being pistol whipped in bed.
