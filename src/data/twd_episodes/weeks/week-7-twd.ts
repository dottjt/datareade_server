"What's your favourite animal?"

- Do you love cats? Dogs!? Horses!?!!?!
- Maybe you have a pet lizard, because you're one of those evil villians my mother would always warn me about.
- I personally love dogs. I have a dog myself, and he's just super cuddly.
- I also keep an afrian american man as a slave, so I guess that's like a pet. Jokes! It's actually an african american woman, because they're nicer.
- And to balance that racist comment out, I will proceed to kill at least 100 pure bred white people in a mass shooting, probably at a church.

Virtual Reality

- I never really understood it.
- Then I tried it at the F1, and holy shit. Incredible. (explain what it's like)
- I then bought a PSVR. I had to go all the way to Richmond for it.
- I remember doing this scuba diving thing.
- Resident Evil 7. Holy shit. Terrifying.
- I sold it eventually because I thought they would make a 2nd one.
- Motion sickness was a huge issue. Dying to play beat saber though.

- I know some people, the first thing that they do is that they read the news. Keeping up to date with Trump's antics.
- Others could care less about what's happening in the world.
- In my case, I can't say I care much for news. Largely because it has a negative impact on my mental health.

Bipolar Disorder

- I'm 99.99% sure I have bipolar disorder.
- I refused to get diagnosed, largely because I don't want it in the system. That and I refuse to take drugs and I refuse to see a specialist.
- I deal with it mostly well, like 90% of the time.
- Honestly, it's both the best and worst thing in the worst.
- Having an episode is like having the most intense focus in the world.
- It's like, that thing which I'm fixed on is the most important thing in the world, and nothing anyone says will convince me otherwise.
- In fact, this podcast is a consequence of that.
- The main thing is to remind myself that it's just my disorder and that it's not actually real.
- So you know, taking breaks when it's the furthest thing in my mind.
- Often manifests into stress.
- Meditation is a great way to maintain balance.

- Secondly, I'll have you know that my penis is huge.
- Not to mention it's in high demand. People love my penis. It's often seen on billboards for the people to enjoy.
- Although let's be honest, the only reason you don't like my penis is because you have other fetishes that I'm simply unaware of.
- Maybe you like a sexy toe. Do toes turn you on?
- What if I lather my elbow slowly, while licking my nipples.
