- Are you a book worm!? Do you wear glasses and look a bit like Harry Potter!?!?
- Maybe instead you have the attention span of a spider, and you simply cannot stand anything more than a standard 280 characters.
- I personally do a lot of reading, but not books. I simply don't have the time.

McDonalds

- It was my first proper job. I was 19.
- I worked the front counter. Maybe because I was articulate. I have no idea.
- I think I didn't mind it because in general it went really quickly.
- I remember trying to hit on the boss's sister.
- I also caused another girl, who mind you was the most popular person in high school, to quit her job following a very severe case of online bullying.
- I also remember sitting on the bus with this guy who also wore the maccas outfit, and he's like where do you work, and I'm like at the mall McDonalds and he's like, yeah that's great experience for when you eventually move to a restaurant and I'm like, hell no!
- You also got 50% off your order if you bought something before or after your shift

Santa Clause from The North Pole

"Hi Julius. It's Santa Clause here. You've been a very naughty boy this year. There's no possible way you're getting a present this year."

- Well, well, well. If it isn't santa clause, that slut!
- I guess since you're not going to get me anything this year, I'm just going to push this disabled lady off her wheelchair and shoot her in the head.
- And while I'm at it, why don't I just step on this small defenseless child. (play child crying sound effect)
- And you know what, I'm going to have sex with Mrs. Clause (simulate me having sex with Mrs. Clause) (Christmas music)
- Oh, and I killed all your reindeers as well.

- Is it something crazy complex like an Indian biryani.
- Toast obviously is a staple of the western world that anyone can cook.

Tumblr

- I think of all the topics to talk about, this one makes me most uncomfortable.
- Probably because it was when I was most unstable with my mental health.
- I think I hit 19 and I don't know why but like out of nowhere I was like, I need to find a girlfriend.
- So I thought I'd go on tumblr because I knew that's where women would hang out. I had a blog.
- In the beginning I was getting nowhere.
- Then it kind of become an obsession and I would spend hours on tumblr trying to find women who lived in melbourne and my area.
- Yeah, I ended up interacting with a lot of girls, almost like experiencing every possible scenario of both like, rejection and success.
- And man, I briefly went out with this 36 year old that I was not into at all, but I was like dying of loneliness.
- ultimately I had like 5 or 6 blogs and it was destroying me. Like dealing with the breakups and the rejection and one day I was like, I just need to stop trying to find women and just focus on myself.
- But there was one girl who was really nice but she said she was already in a relationship, so I basically dismissed her.
- And I was like, you know, I'll add you on facebook because I could at least see her as being a friend. And within 5 minutes of chatting, I knew instantly that we would be in a long term relationship.
- And here we are.

- Having killed all of my sisters, allowing me to reign supreme as the only remaining sibling left there's a few ways you can approach this.
- I personally went the koolaid route. I spiked their milk with cyanide that morning and let's say that their cereal was a little more milky than usual.
- Oh course one of them managed to survive, so I had to shoot her in the pussy and watch her bleed for days on end until she finally passed out.
- Maybe you can her tampon with some C4, and then during gym class blow her up in front of all the other kids.
- Or maybe alternatively you can be less shit and learn to tease her back, ya lil' pussy. You worthless piece of shit!

"What was the best holiday you ever went on?"

- I know a lot of families like to go camping during the summer holidays. Road trips gallore.
- Maybe your idea of holiday was the period between 6 and 11am where your dad wouldn't beat you each day because he was passed out from a night of drinking.
- I don't know actually, but I think when I went to noosa as a kid with my mother. That's a memorable one.
- But gee, I've been a lot of places. Europe was pretty good. China. But yeah, I'm not sure. They didn't really seem like holidays to me, they felt more like obligations.

Macbook

- I was late to the laptop game. I got my 1st laptop when I was 20 or 21 I think?
- But I'd never had or used a mac up until then, but it was the tiny 11 inch macbook air. And wow, I instantly fell in love with it.
- It was like, holy shit. I can use my computer anywhere. On the train. On my bed.
- But I don't know, it was a bit of a magic experience. Up until then I was basically using my phone for everything.
- Luckily enough it turns out that you can also develop on a macbook much more easily than with a windows laptop. So if I didn't get one, I probably woud have never become a professional developer.

"I think my Razer BlackWidow keyboard has cancer. How should I spend my last moments with my favourite computer peripheral?"

- I understand Khloe that it must be a very difficult time for you and your family.
- Really it's about developing some solid and sincere memories with your keyboard until it eventually passes away.
- Personally I very much like to interact with my keyboard, primarily with my left hand while I was watching porn and jerking my penis with my right hand.
- First step is to remove any unpleasant memories. Especially any touch screens you have around the house, obviously reminding your keyboard of it's obsolescence.
- Maybe together you could set a new world record in terms of the longest consecutive minutes typed on a keyboard? I imagine that would be a powerful bonding experience.
- Maybe you could type a full sentence using only CAPS Lock, I imagine that would be an eclectic experience for your keyboard.
- Maybe you could pay a stripper to potentially motorboat your keyboard. You know, live it up, a little.
- A very sad viewermail.
