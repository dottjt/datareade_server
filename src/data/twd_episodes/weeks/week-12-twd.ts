- Are you obsessed with growth? Maximising your potential as an individual? Unlocking that third eye!?
- Maybe instead your dream is to eventually morph into a potato, and be dipped into a tub of gravy, to be consumed at a later date.
- I'm pretty obsessed with self-improvement and bettering myself (explain)

The Simpsons

- I was born in 1993 so I basically grew up in the heyday of the simpsons.
- I remember watching it everynight after or during dinner and yeah, it was just a great shop. It was on at like 5pm or 6pm, I don't remember.
- In a sense as a kid it kind of was the best show. Like, you had cartoons like arthur and and they were great, but it just wasn't as good.
- I think it's also that thing which almost everyone watched, so it was like something that everyone had in common.
- It's crazy to see new episodes because they're so, so well produced it's crazy.
- With that said, I think sort of The Simpsons worked in the 90s. Now it's a lot less relevant.
- I can't stand people who are obsessed with The Simpsons though.

Tiffany Brooks from Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain.

"Hey Julius, my fellow convicted pedophile. I have difficulty getting it up during sex, and that bothers me. Should I begin having sex with actual people instead?"

- I mean, uh. Definitely having sex with actual people is the preferred way to go about sex in general.
- But the good news however is that Julius Reade is a qualified therapist (not actually a therapist) so I'm more than happy to help psycho analyse your obvious mental illness.
- Let's see here, according to my big book of TRUTH based on what you've said, it looks like you have a severe case of beastiality!
- And according to this quite large and therefore official book, it looks like the only cure is in fact to have sex with me, Julius Reade.
- (assuming of course you are in fact a woman, and you don't have one of those man faces, because I won't be able to cum if you have a man face)
- We can start out easy. I can dress up as a goat. I can use actual severed goat hooves to touch your breasts.
- Then eventually after day 200, you should be cured of all indecent fetishes, as well as an official carrier of more than 25 known STD's.

Magic

- I've always been like a hardcore skeptic when it comes to everything.
- Anyway, I met this girl on Tumblr and she was telling me about magic and all these supernatural type things that have happened to her life.
- I mean, don't get me wrong, it's probably because she had massive tits and I lost my virginity to her and she was like autistic.
- So there was a period where I was like really into it.
- So do I believe in magic now? I don't know.
- I think in the end what I've come to realise is that if you want to believe something then that will make it real? Like, if you believe in magic, you'll notice more odd things in your life and you'll assume it's because of magic?
- But if you don't have that belief, then those odds things will still happen but you simply won't have that awareness.
- Would love to spend time when I'm older to study the occult and that kind of thing.

- Unfortunately Madison, it may seem that we're too late. And it would look like you have in fact, become a robot. (play robot sound)
- Thankfully since you've made a successful transition into your new life, you now get to choose what kind of robot you'll become.
- Maybe you want to become one of those sex slave robots. I would definitely be down for that. I mean, finally someone will be able to fit in my huuuuuuge penis.
- I know it's highly prestigious to be one of those Toyota factory robots. Putting cars together for ther greater good of humanity.
- Killer robots I know are in high demand for hollywood films, and I know Kim John Un has been known to own quite a few, so The Reade can hook you up with another' yella.
- Maybe you even want to be a cyborg, part human, part robot.
- Of course the point is that robots have feelings and need love too. Me and my dyson vaccum have been known to hang out on friday nights. (play vaccum sound effect)

Saxophone

- I played the Saxophone for like 8 years growing up. Basically up until the end of high school. I played in all sorts of high school bands n' stuff, that's probably a topic for another time.
- I think the idea was to help me get a music scholarship.
- I remember I had this Chinese teacher and he would have constant fights with his wife mid-lesson. Also, he got done for child sex offences, so he's currently in jail right now.
- I got really good at it. Like, definitely wasn't the best, but I was decent. I think I did up to grade 8.
- But of course, like all stories there is the downfall. I basically stopped practicing and I lost my embouchure.
- So to compensate I had to bite down really hard on my lip, and I could barely play for longer than like 30 minutes.
- I don't think I could see myself playing it again. I was essentially forced into it as a kid.

"Hey Julius. I had a pretty shitty childhood, but now that I'm an adult I'm looking for revenge. Can you suggest ways for me to sexually abuse my father without breaking the law?"

- Ideally you'd probably see a therapist, but obviously if that were the case you wouldn't be listening to this show and you'd be taking your mental health seriously.
- So instead, it's Goober hour with The Reade and here are my humble recommendations.
- You could wet willy your father with your cock while he's sleeping, I know that's an Australian classic. Also known the dunkin' willy.
- Maybe on his birthday you could just casually milk his breast at the dinner table, while mum proceeds to down another glass of wine to deal with the constant drama in your family.
- Although realistically this is something that you really should be taking out on yourself. I hear fight club is a great way to relieve some stress.
- A safe bet of course would be to sexually molest your children and continue the cycle, like any good dad would do.
