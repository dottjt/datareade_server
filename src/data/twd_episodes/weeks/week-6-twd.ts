"What was your favourite toy growing up?"

- Kids be crazy about the cup n' ball.
- I hope your favourite toy wasn't a dilo, or something.
- I was pretty crazy about Thomas the Tank Engine when I was a child.
- And definitely video game consoles were largely what kept me from killing myself as a kid, so there you go.

Typewriters

- Back when I was really into handwriting, I was really into collecting typeswiters.
- I remember my first typewriter. It was electric.
- I used it to write romantic letters to my partner.
- In the end, I realised that collecting is a dead end (explain)
- Although I did get a typewriter that can write in cursive, and I still have it to this day.
- Thankfully I only ever bought probably like 5 typewriters in total.

"Hey Julius. I really need your help! Not just because you're a sexy Asian, but also because my dad left me when I was only seven years' old. Dear Julius, can you please help me find him?"
 My dad left me when I was seven. Can you please help find him?"

- I hate to say it, but I am your father.
- So I imagine there's a lot of stuff that I simply never got around to teaching you, so I thought we'd do a quick one on one.
- Don't do drugs. (Unless if they're free drugs, then have as many as you can physically put in your mouth)
- A bit of advice: You will never be enough. You will always be inadequate as a human being.
- Cooking meth is also an important skill for kids to learn.
- Obviously I'm going to have to teach you to tie a knot. (I'm definitely not referring to marriage, because your mother was a complete bitch)
- Get on the porn early. It's really

- This is a difficult one to answer. There's just so much that anyone can say.
- Have you killed someone perhaps? Are you emotionally abusive? Are you a black mother?
- Just a lot of bullying and possibly even to a point where someone actually quit their job and I don't want to say that they killed themself, because I can't prove that, but I was a terrible person.

- My brother is actually half carpet, so I can relate to your situation.
- I like to really just step on carpet, that's how I show love.
- Carpets also hate to be pissed on, so definitely don't piss on your husband, unless if he's into that kind of thing.
- Carpets are also very sensitive to dust and mould, so be sure to clean out your vagina and stay clean.
- Try avoid stepping on wood floors as well, they see that as ...well, frankly betrayal.
- Especially when you come home smelling of hard wood. Talkin' about an awkward situation.
