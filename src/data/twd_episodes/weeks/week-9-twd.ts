"What would you do if you had a million dollars?"

- Spend it baby! Fast cars.
- Perhaps you'd invest it into Bitcoin or the S&P5 million.
- If I had a million dollars, I'd probably pay off my mortgage and then travel the world. Actually, I'd probably buy a house in Japan and live there for a while.

Saturday School

- Firstly, FAKE NEWS. It was either a Saturday or Sunday.
- I hated it. Usually it was Chinese, English and then Maths.
- I was terrible at Chinese. The only thing that kept me going was that I lived in China for a year.
- With that said, some fond memories. Mostly traumatic memories though.
- I remember I had that crush whom was my crush and we awkwardly never spoke about it even though we really wanted to. Crazy times.
- Basically what I've realised is that my entire life is bludging my way thruogh everything.

Aaron Carter from Srinagar, India.

"Hey Julius. Loving the hair. I think I have grass growing inside me. Does that turn you on?"

- Well Aaron, that depends on a number of factors.
- I like a nice firm grass. But also I like the wisp elusiveness of moss, so that's something which gets my goat.
- I also like a pure grass. None of this cross-bred shit.
- Another thing to consider, is your grass well-watered? No one likes a dry grass, acrid grass.
- Of course, inspite of the variances I love all grass, and I have been known to wank liberally on my lawn, on a daily. Sometimes even hourly.
- So by all means, send me pictures of your grass along with a paypal link, and I'll see what I can do.

- Or would you be indifferent? Would you not care?
- Perhaps you would feel happy. Maybe you hate your parents that much?
- I think even though I no longer keep in contact with my parents for various reasons, I think I'd still be sad about it.

- As head of the Australian Central Intelligence Unit, it's imperative that you tell us more details about your father.
- Does he like plastic cheese, or regular tasty? Obviously very important for us to know.
- Does your dad listen to The Writer's Daily? Can we get him to donate some money at all?
- Also does he like his Kimchi hot or mild?
- Also really important, do you have any dick pics of your fathers? Purely for research purposes, and possibly to turn into mass market memorabilia.

- I will also just outright blow you for $80.
- Maybe you want to use me as a vessel for sex for a VR porn experience. That's actually less than a blow job. That's $2.50.

- Absolutely, it is totally fine to kill immigrants. But also, it's about being culturally sensitive.
- Killing a Japanese man with a samurai sword for example, is blatatnt stereotyping.
- You definitely don't want to kill an african man while in blackface and a tribal outfit with a spear.
