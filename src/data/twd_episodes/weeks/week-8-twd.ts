"What did you used to have for lunch as a kid?"

- Peanut butter sandwiches are obviously a popular choice for white children.
- Maybe you're one of those weird asian kids who ate rice for lunch and all the other kids made fun of you.
- I had a bit of everything. I remember having tomato/cheese sandwhiches, those biscuit with cheese dip things, avocado sandwhichs which everyone made fun of me for, even though it was delicious.
- I definitely never had any of the fancy stuff though.

Caffeine

- I've never been into cafeeine. I never understood the point of it.
- Don't get me wrong, I love the taste of coffee, but it absolutely destroys my sleep. It doesn't even make me energetic, it just makes me jittery.
- (talk about negative side effects)
- Water. Now there's a delicious beverage.
- At the end of the day, almost everyone complains about being addicted to caffeine, and it's like, what the hell did you expect?
- Besides, there are much better drugs. Have you tried LSD!?!?

"Hey Julius. I have copious amounts of iron ore stuck inside my vagina, and China are keen on extracting it. \
However, I don't feel comfortable with a bunch of Chinese miners boring holes inside my vagina. What should I do?"

- I mean, I guess it depends. What are the Chinese willing to pay for all that iron ore you're hoarding in there?
- How big is your vagina? Are we talking a few billion ton of ore?
- Let's be honest, this really is a matter of national resource security. We can't let the Chinese by Indonesian ore.
- I suggest a boycott. I think you should effective cock block Chinese miners from accessing your ore.

- Or perhaps you are the agnostic type. Prone to not really caring much about anything.

- Colemak is an alternative keyboard layout.
- (talk about benefits)
  + finger distance between keys.
  + More comfortable.
- Great online programs if you want to touch type.
- I used to play a game called typeracer (explain)
- Admittedly I do struggle a little bit with typing in QWERTY, but I very rarely have to write in QWERTY.
- I highly recommend it. I'm the only person I've met irl who actually uses it.

"Hey Julius. My penis is currently bulging from out of my pants, I need to get off the train, \
but the train is currently packed with a bunch of school children and I'm worried about molesting \
them with my bulging penis. Please send help!."

- Unfortunately Grace, I'm currently stuck at the fine Writer's Daily studios, so I can't actually physically be there to help you.
- Pissing yourself is usually the easiest way to get people to clear a path and stay away from you, so that's on the table. (of course, it will also completely ruin your credibility)
- Technically speaking, punching a child is less severe than molesting a child. So you may want to take a first strike approach. Of course, the CCTV will capture you also having a boner, so you'll get done for both physical and sexual assault.
- Personally speaking, that's why I like to carry a gun at all times. Because you can just pick em' off, one by one.
- Aaaaand that was my 100th killing child joke. Thank you. thank you.

- As a kid, people who had Foxtel were the best. You'd basically just be watching Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon.
- I guess like as a kid, parents that had foxtel, it was like a sign of status. Same with having more than one gaming console.
- Of course, it is grosly expensive.
