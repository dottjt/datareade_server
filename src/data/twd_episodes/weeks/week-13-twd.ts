- I know some people are obsessed with flying. Maybe they were raped by a pigeon when they were younger.
- Extreme elasticity is often a human fetish that I'm sure some people would love to partake in.
- I'd love to be super smart and be able to learn things super quickly. I think that would be an awesome super power to have.

"Hey Julius. Loving what you're doing with your pubic hair these days. I really like delicious biscuits. Can you tell me where I can get delicious biscuits?"

- Well you know, the super market is obviously a good place to start with your clear obsession with biscuits.
- But listen if you want the good shit, you really need to start putting yourself out there, because there's nothing better than a freshly baked biscuit.

- Do you struggle to go five minutes without both talking or inserting your penis into another human being?
- Maybe you prefer the comfort of darkness within the confines of your own lonely room.
- I'm definitely introverted. I'm happy not to see anyone for years. As long as I have a computer screen, I'm fine.
- And I think the reason for this is because I feel like my thoughts are another person? I don't feel lonely with my thoughts.

- Well, first thing is to get distracted and go onto pornhub.com and have a quick wank.
- Next step is to get further distracted by a bunch of funny YouTube videos.
- Then obviously at this point it's time to have another wank.
- Then and only then is it okay to actually do what you wanted to do on the internet and actually send an email.
