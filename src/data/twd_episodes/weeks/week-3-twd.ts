How much do you care about money?

- Are you one of those hardcore capitalists? Where you dream of decapitating socialists by the mouthful.
- In my case, I would say I care about money more than the average person.
- I have a mortgage and I am firmly entrenched in the rat race.
- Plus, money is sexy. You tried masturbating with a dollar bill? It's delicious.

Productivity

- I used to be obsessed with productivity. (It's probably why I'm a bit bipolar)
- (give examples)
- In the end I realised that balance is more important, and that productivity isn't an absolute thing.
- Of course, productivity isn't everything. Happiness is also important.
- Have you ever tried lying on the floor and stare at the ceiling? That's a whole new world down there.

"Ever since listening to the show, I've developed an intense desire to blow you. \
However, my religion forbids oral sex. What should I do, ever so wise one?"

- In my case I like to practice to foreign objects.
- Maybe we can setup some VR thing where you pretend to blow me over the internet.
- And if orgies are exempt from your religion, maybe we can get some of the guys over and we'll have a grand ol' time.

Podcasting

- I thought I'd talk about my relationship with podcasting.
- I've been doing podcasting and radio since I was 16. (talk about why you love it.)
- (talk about some of the shows you've done)
- Actually, it probably started when I was a lot younger annd I'd just record myself speaking.
- I love entertaining people and making them laugh.
- Problem is that it doesn't pay well. So it's a side thing and that's also what makes it great. (lack of pressure etc.)

Weed

- I remember I 1st smoked weed when I was 18 or 19.

- For like the 1st year of uni it was like, once a week.
- (watch music videos and play video games)
- And then I started hanging out with a bad crowd (not so much because of weed, but because I was depressed)
- Then one day I was hanging with the lads and I just stopped enjoying it.
- Nowadays I'm basically 100% sober. I don't drink, I don't smoke weed.

- Have you tried peanut butter? I know that goes down a real treat.
- Now to deal with the scaring, it's best that you use a knife. Just chop off the excess.
