"What's your favourite tree?"

- The only reason I ask this is because I asked a girl this once as a joke to flirt with her, and she took it seriously and actually had a heap of answers.
- The point of this question is that no one should ever have a favourite tree.
- Admitting that you like nature is lame.
- On the other hand, admitting that you're addicted to porn or drugs, is in fact cool and highly recommended by The Reade.

University

- I hated university with a passion. I hated the people. I hated the culture. I hated going to lectures and learning.
- To me it was a useless piece of paper that I needed in order to get a job. Not just useful, but expensive.
- I went to no lectures. I did thee bare attendance for tutorials, which was 75%.
- I think because I was pursuing podcasting and youtube at the time, and that's what I wanted my future to be.
- I think also because I studied journalism and everyone was very stand offish.
- I think I tried the debating club as well, but I absolutely hated it.

Samantha Lee from Derby, United Kingdom.

"I'm a real tubby bitch, and I have immense self-esteem issues as a result. I know this because I enjoy being spat on sexually. What should I do?"

- Well Samantha, I think it's completely normal to enjoy being spat on sexually.
- It's even actually one of the row's on Maslow's heirachy of needs. You have food, shelter, and then of course above that being spat on, just below love and belonging.
- With that said, weight loss is obviously never a bad thing.
- I recommend maybe looking into anorexia. Because when you fear being overweight all the time, then there's no way you'll be fat again.
- Of course, it's not really about how much you weigh or even what you look like.
- It's about how you feel on the inside, which is why it's super important that you also develop a drug addiction. Drugs make everything better.
- You never see a sad person on heroin. And if you do, then I promise it's all fake news.
- If you're having difficult sourcing, then don't worry. I know a guy, and although I advise brining a gun, his heroin is absolutely going to get you manged off your head.

- Are you a lover of interacial porn, because you're actually a white supremacist and it makes you feel all dirty inside?
- I myself am a recovering porn addict, so this is a terrible question. But man, I love all porn. I could literally sit there and watch it for days at a time.

Hot30 Countdown

- Growing up when I was in like, late primary school, early primary school there was a radio show from like 6pm to 9pm or whatever it was. This was like 2004, at the very least.
- And they'd play like all the radio hits from 30 to 1. Mainly, I really liked the main host. Who I think is still going.
- Basically I'd listen to it while doing my homework.
- But what I liked about listening to the radio is that it felt like a sense of community as a kid. This was before the internet was a huge, huge thing.
- Anyway, that's all in the past. Now it's all about discord servers and gang bangs and whatever kids do these days.

- As a former pedophile hunter back in the late 50s' I can at least teach you the basics so good ol' readie boy doesn't go out and catch you.
- For starters, listening to Michael Jackson is a dead giveaway that you're a pedophile, so try and listen more to nursery rhymes and hip-hop, because that's what the youngins are into.
- Definitely don't hang around kindergartens, because it's much easier to pray on children online.

William S. Burroughs

- William S. Burroughs is a writer.
- He comes from the beat generation.
- He wrote my favourite book of all time, Naked Lunch. Which is actually a terrible book in a lot of ways, but I think reading it as a young adult was kind of exhilirating.
- It's just a lot of attitude and it was very abstract. I liked how non-linear it was. That to me was exciting.
- My novel which I'm writing at the moment, How to kill a chinaman, was initially inspired by naked lunch. I tried to write it like naked lunch, but I didn't get very far.
- In the end it was a lot more narrative driven, but I'm very happy with how it's turning out. It's like, half attitude. Half comprehensible fun.
