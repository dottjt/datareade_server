How To Feel Empowered About Your Recovery

- Empowerment is actually a really simple concept in the context of recovery.
- Essentially, all empowerment is is having confidence in your own mental health strategy.
- Put simply, your recovery is only as effective as your mental health routine.
- You live and die by your routine.
- So in order to feel empowered, you essentially need to have confidence that the actions you're taking are allowing to have control over your mental health.
- For most people it's as simple as meditating 10 minutes each day.
- Empowerment isn't about inflating your ego or feeling like some kind of God.
- It's about having confidence in your behaviours.
- Of course, if you're wondering what that process is, you can checkout the NFD website.

Aaliyah Baker from Zamboanga City, Philippines.

"I'm twelve and I have trouble taking a solid dick pic. I've tried all sorts of techniques and angles, but I can't quite get to look how I want it. Can you please help Mr. Reade?"

- Firstly, please don't call me Mr. Reade. It's creepy.
- Secondly, for legal reasons obviously I cannot encourage a twelve year old such as yourself to take dick pics.
- But what I can do instead is recommend some super cool teenage activities!
- Fortnite!?!? Skateboarding!?!? Isn't that what the cool kids are doing these days? Maybe your parents recently divorced
- Of course, maybe you're not actually twelve years old and you're actually an ashamed 30 year old with the equivalent penis of a twelve year old.
- Then what I can recommend is to shave that bush right back, and basically angle the camera as if it were infused with your chest.
- That way you can get a really long shot and it'll make it look like you have a solid 12 incher.
- Not that I do that, because my penis is hella big.

Why Do We Have Wet Dreams?

- Wet dreams can happen for any number of reasons.
- In general they're a result of having an unbalanced mind. In a sense you can think of them as a subconscious relapse.
- A common misconception is that they're uncontrollable, but that's not true. Essentially, you don't have wet dreams when you're mentally balanced.
- I can definitely say I've only had wet dreams when I've been depressed or not really caring about my recovery or the result of what happens with it.
- Essentially if you're not mentally balanced, then it means there's a gap in your recovery strategy.
- Maybe you're not handling those difficult emotions efficiently. Maybe you're feeling stressed and over-worked. Maybe you're not being consistent with your meditation.
- At the end of the day, it's about focusing on your mental health.

- I know Brandon that life must be incredibly difficult for you. Especially in modern Japan with the long work hours and rigid heirarchy.
- But no matter how difficult it gets, I just want to let youy know that The Reade loves you.
- But of course, I would love you even more if you were to subscribe to the podcast and leave a lovely review on our Castbox or iTunes channel.
- And you know, life is definitely worth living knowing that you're giving money to a good cause, so for a measely sum of $10,000 to me, Julius Reade, I promise you that you will feel a sense of purpose like never before.
- Listen Brandon, I will blow you if you help me do my taxes. That's how much life is worth living.
- On the other hand if you're kind of poor, then eh, it's probably worth killing yourself. But who knows, maybe you can take a second credit card out. Just sayin'.

Recovery Is The Reward

- Today is a simple message that I bring forth to thy listener.
- Basically, that your successful recovery is the reward at the end of the day.
- A lot of addicts quite obviously have an addition mindset. It's kind of like, well if I get to abstain for a period of time, then I get to reward myself with video games.
- What they don't realise is that recovery itself is a process of desensitising and simply not wanting.
- And because people remain addicted for so long, they don't really understand what it means to not be addicted.
- So I'll spell it out. Once you're recovered, you do not crave porn at all. It's not even a thought.
- It's the worst when people are like, yeah but it's just normal to be horny all the time, but it's not true at all.
- I can verify 100% that it is something that you have control over and which you can control.
- So yeah, I hope that helps.

"Hey Julius. You gay homosexeal." (alright, that's a rough start)
"I think my dad has a urine fetisth, because the way he shows affection is by peeing on me. I think it's kind of disturbing as I'm only twelve. Should I tell my father how I feel?"

- You see, your dad clearly has mental health issues, which is why it's important that you learn to bottle your emotions so you can avoid further disappointment with your life.
- I suggest building up your tolerance to piss. Maybe start with drinking a quarter cup of piss each day with breakfast, and slowly working your way to one cup.
- Alternatively you could just drink American Beer! BOOM! That's right! I went there! Ya beer is terrible.
- Obviously murdering your father is an option. A knife to the throat.
- But whatever you do, definitely don't tell your father how you feel. Because as everyone knows, open communication with someone you care about is one the most destructive things you can possibly do.
- And you know, cutting your wrists is also a great way to go about it as well. You know as they say, a cut a day keeps the rapists away. Or something.

When Was The Last Time You Masturbated?

- This isn't something fundamental to your recovery, but I think there's still a lot we can learn from this question.
- Ultimately, it doesn't matter when you last masturbated. It doesn't matter how many times you've masturbated. It really doesn't matter what you masturbated to.
- A lot of people get fixated on these meaningless details and they allow it to dictate their recovery.
- If your focus is on the type of porn you watched and how you worry that it's changed your sexuality or how that particular fetish has quote-unquote "messed you up" your focus is in the wrong place.

- At the end of the day it's about your mental health. Not about your preference. Your preference is just a symptom, it is not the cause.
- So really the take away of this segment is not to get caught up in meaningless metrics.
- Your mental health is king. Always.

- Oats are definitely gay. Anything that's remotely good for you is gay as hell.
- But of course, maybe you actually are gay. Then that's completely okay!
- I offer two very helpful self-help courses that may help you, the first one is called "Coming to terms with being gay, an acceptance guide by the reade" which is fairly.

How To Form More Productive Habits

- There's a few different angles to this question, but I also think there's a right way to approach this question.
- And I want to begin by saying that everyone seems to have a very perverted view on what is considered productive.
  - People think it's all about studying, learning new skills, pushing ourselves, making money etc.
  - Instead, I like to think of these things as symptoms. These are things you do when you have a great system in place, but they are not the goal.
  - The goal is to be happy, to have purpose and to do things which excite you. That's what's going to help you study harder or want to learn new things.
- So how do you be happy and have purpose? Well, it all begins with your mental health and in particular, when you have mental balance.
- It's really hard to have long term, sustainable ambition if you're not mentally balanced.
- So I guess I gave you the incredibly high level overview of this question.
- You know, I could have said, well it's about having this particular routine or w/e. But if you're not mentally stable, then it's really hard to pursue anything at all.

"Hey Julius. Is it okay to sexualise mental illness? I personally like girls who are obsessive compulsive, because they give great head."

- I would say it's probably okay to sexualise women with mental illness, as long as you physically abuse them as well.
- You see, life is about taking something bad and utterly destroying it so that it's in a much worse condition once you're done with it. An important life lesson for you kids out there.
- But of course, you also need to think of the long term costs if you were to date a girl with mental illness.
- You have to pay for the pills and the therapy and it's like, is it really worth it for just a bit of head? WELL, OBVIOUSLY BUCKO!!!
- But of course, I kid. It's not okay to sexualise mental illness, because mental illness is a serious condition that millions of people struggle with on a daily basis.
- Which is why it's perfectly okay to kill someone with mental illness, effectively putting them out of their misery.
