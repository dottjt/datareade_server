Why Do We Relapse?

- There are any number of reasons why we relapse. Circumstance obviously being one of them.
- However today I want to talk more broadly on a fundamental level, rather than uncover specific reasons.
- Ultimately relapse comes down to losing mental balance. Of course, if you've never had mental balance then basically you're leaving your recovery to chance and that's a big no-no.
- Here's the deal with relapse. Relapse doesn't happen at the point of orgasm. Because that's not the point which you lost mental balance.
- You lose mental balance the moment you make a decision which causes you to derail.
- For example, you decide that you're above the process and that you're going to skill out on meditation that one time, which result in you not feeling as calm as you should be, which derails your mood.
- So basically, if you want to stop relapsing, you need to figure out how to maintain mental balance.
- How do you do that? Obviously by reading the neverfapdeluxe website (hint: it comes down to meditation and developing your awareness)

bob smith. Montgomery, Alabama

"Hey Julius. I heard smashing your dick with a hammer repeatedly makes you last longer in bed. Is this true?"

- I can confirm that is no... is true! Is in fact true.
- It's based on the Julius Reade method of hardness, which guarantees a similar potency to that of viagra.
- Basically you just lay your supple penis onto any kind of work bench, and then smash it vigorously with a hard object.
- Not only is it proven to increase blood flood, but it also helps eliminate the competition, so I can then swoop in and have sex with your desired lady.
- And also smashing your penis with a hammer has been proven to cure depression. I can't remember where, I think it was in one of those trusted publications like the new york times.
- I find though it's more effective if you use the hammer on her, rather than on yourself. It just helps... mellow her out.

You Don't Realise You Have A Problem Until You Attempt Recovery

- This isn't really so much a discussion as it is a piece of perspective that I'd like to share with you.
- Basically, you don't realise how difficult recovery is until you attempt recovery.
- And I think on a subsconsious level we know this, which is perhaps why a lot of us don't even bother to attempt recovery until we hit absolute rock bottom.
- I think a large part of the reason why it's hard is because people just don't really know how to go about recovery.
- When you think about, when porn and masturbation is literally all you know in terms of how you cope and your mental well being to a large extent, then to take that away is essentially asking someone to start from scratch.
- It's almost like learning a new language from scratch. It's scary, it's unfamiliar and it's almsot unpleasant.
- Worst of all is when people assume that recovery is just inherently difficult and inherently impossible.
- Well, I'm here to tell you that recovery doesn't have to be hard. You just have to know how.

Andrew Gray from Ibadan, Nigeria.

"Hey Julius. I think you are the best person ever. I've unfortunately developed a severe case of wanker's cramp from masturbating far too much, and yet I simply cannot stop masturbating due to my porn addiction! What should I do delicious daddy reade!?!?!"

- Unfortunately Andrew, it may look like the only way to help you is by cutting your hands off.
- It is the only known cure for wanker's cramp, aside from obviously from stopping masturbating, but as everyone knows, masturbating is perfectly healthy, even more so that meditation and exercise.
- And let's be honest, no one really uses their hands anyway. They're just weird clumpy bits at the end of your arms.
- I mean, I don't even remember the last time I even used those useless things anyway. Now feet. There's something I can get on board with.
- You never see a pervert develop a severe hand fetish, do you now! You sicko! Weird hand loving freak.
- But Andrew, have you tried cramping your hand further? You know, maybe you can develop some kind of immunity to it, allowing you to effectively masturbate forever.
- Alternatively, maybe I'd be down for masturbating you. I can use my hands, maybe even my mouth if I'm busy writing a SHOPPING LIST or whatever it is I do in my spare time.
- (whisper - call me. I'll be waiting)

Is Porn Bad For You?

- So this question is a bit of a misnomer, because in the context of recovery there is no good or bad.
- Basically, your addict brain doesn't care about what's good or bad. It simply desires.
- So deciding whether porn is good or bad for you is largely irrelevant in the context of recovery.
- In fact, deciding whether it's good or bad is a process of rationalisation, because inherently it is not possible to rationalise addiction.
- And as per the NFD website, rationalisation is in fact an unhealthy coping mechanism. sO please refrain from that.
- Now back to the question of whether porn is bad for you: Well, it's a completely individual thing.
- At the end of the day, there are simply behaviours. There are no good or bad behaviours. Good and bad are labels to describe these behaviours.
- What this means is that it's up to you decide whether watching porn as a behaviours, helps you become your best person.
- For some people it's bad, for some people it's neutral, for some people it's good.

Andrew Cox from Paramaribo, Suriname.

"Hey Julius. My brother from another mother! How do I increase my girth?"

- As a man of girth I have a lot of perspective to answer this question.
- Short answer, mostly steroids and filler, if you want to have a meaty trunk.
- But no! Girth is all about attitude my friend!
- You can literally feel another man's girth just by listening to the way he speaks.
- As you can tell, I'm literally projecting girth INTO YOUR MOUTH like there's no tomorrow, based on how sexy my voice is.
- I also use a penis pump at least twice a day, just to ensure that I DOMINATE in both my online and sexual life.
- Of course, maybe you can't afford filler. Then I can recommend any kind of plant based protein.
- Nothing quite like injecting banana pulp into your penis at 3 in the morning because you're worried about how others will perceive you.

The Importance Of Meditation For An Effective Recovery

- From a practice perspective, Meditation really is the foundation of any effective recovery.
- What meditation does is that it helps you develop the awareness in order to change your behaviours, which ultimately affects your mental balance.
- From a conceptual point of view recovery is fundamentally about mental balance, but the way we achieve that is through meditation.
- In terms of what meditation is, essentially the process of learning to let go. Letting go of thoughts, ideas, judgement - essentially emptying your mind.
- Here's the key point to understand: Our minds are technically already aware. But what happens is that we overthink, we judge and this clouds our ability to be aware.
- What meditation aims to do is remove all those thoughts and judgements, so that we are merely present with ourselves. And when we're present, it's really easy to identify the areas in our life where we suffer and engage with negative behaviours. (obviously so then we can change them)
- So that's the basics.
- Another key point I would like to introduce is that it's really important to start out with guided meditation.
- So yeah, hopefully that helps!

Anna Anderson from Pittsburgh, United States.

"I think I've developed a taste for precum, although actual cum disgusts me because of how strong it tastes. Can you please recommend any desserts which might go well with my favourite condiment?"

- Well Anna, I won't lie it's kinda hot, to know that a personal fan of the show finds precum tasty. I may even be developing some precum myself right now Anna. Assuming you're over 18, otherwise it's just a bit of sweat.
- I personally like a nice fondue with a bit of precum laid on top of the cheesy goodness that is swiss melted cheese.
- Personally I find precum is best fresh straight from the source, like a delicious oyster caught only moments earlier.
- That's why I like to have access to an uncircumcised cock at all times, just to know that I can fulfil the quench which is precum.
- In terms of desserts Anna, I mean. Is my penis not sweet enough for you, baby? You know, of course, assuming you're over 18.
- But don't worry, like all whores much like myself, you will come to appreciate the taste of actual cum. It will be a heavenly moment for you, and one which I share with my children to this very day.

Never Blame Your Circumstances

- Excuses, excuses, excuses.
- The worst is when you're trying to engage in a recovery discussion with someone, and then they're like "but I've always struggled with porn, or I don't have time to meditate, or I've always had depression"
- And it's like, Daddy Reade has had enough!
- For starters, your past has nothing to do with what you can achieve today. Fact is if you even have the most average human brain, you still have the capacity to be self-aware and become the best version of yourself.
- Here's the deal. You being addicted to porn is not an excuse to be addicted to porn. There is no excuse
- Your circumstances don't dictate how you live your life. You dictate how you live your life, because you make the decisions at the end of the day.

- I think what happens is that people try a million different things, but they still continue to struggle with their recovery, so they instinctively assume that it's not them. Rather, it's everything else.
- The truth is, it is you. You are the problem, because you don't know to beat this.
- Your porn addiction is not the problem. It's merely a symptom to your problem. Your problem is that you just don't know how to control your mind yet, nor do you know how to get to a point of how you can then eventually control your mind.

- Obviously apologising to your sister probably might help. I know women love a good tit grab as well, especially siblings, just to show that you really care.
- Assuming you haven't gone to court yet, I definitely recommend sleeping with the judge. It's always worked for me personally, and hey. Free sex, is good sex.
- Chances are however, you probably don't have a big penis like I do Audrey, so you won't be able to impress the judge all that much. What will inferior, subhuman penis.
- So you may just have to get used to being raped every night by your cell mate.
- Which isn't too bad if you're into S&M and in general the degradation that is listening to The NeverFap Deluxe Daily.
- And for godsakes, just spend the money to get a proper good brand fleshlight. Okay? For $40 dollars you're looking at something mid-range, well built and you can pass onto your kids.
