Why Guided Meditation Is So Important

- The reason why is because it turns out I was meditation incorrectly for a very long time.
- Meditating without a guide is like learning to speak based on what you've heard other people speak. Imagine trying to learn french without understanding any grammar, spelling, even pronounciation.
- This is probably why there's so much misconception about meditation.
- (quick explanation of what the purpose of meditation is) - Start with behaviours.
- I can recommend Sam Harris, I also have my own guided meditations.
- I've been thinking of recording more recently.

"Julius, I keep matching with asians on tinder, Is it because I'm a hairy white coloniser man? Is there some secret to getting laid with an asian girl that im just unaware of? Do i have to cook them a special dish? HELP JULIUS WHAT DO I DO?!?!?!"

- The key with asian women is to be as white as possible. Asian women loves white guys.
- I also have yellow fever, so I personally like to soak my face in bleach at least 5 hours a day.
- Industrial strength white paint, will also do you many favours.
- Dim Sims and Spring Rolls, also highly popular with asian women. I like to slip one inside her during sex.
- Learning to use chopsticks is also super important, mostly out of self-defence when she attempts to take over your bank account and leave you DRY.
- The main however, is to actually just carry a gun, because irrespective of race, social status, wealth - no woman will ever turn you down if you have a gun.
- But that's illegal, so definitely don't do that.

Distraction Is The Opposite Of Recovery

- Today I want to talk about coping mechanisms (that is, unhealthy coping mechanisms)
- Distraction is an unhealthy coping mechanism (why, because it doesn't help you develop awareness)
- (talk about why awareness is so important, as an alternative)
- The only reason why we pursue distraction, is because it's what we've taught ourselves to do.
- The easiest way to break these cycles is through understanding

"Hey Julius. You have the most fantastic face I have ever seen!"
"My boyfriend has a severe porn addiction, and I'm not sure how I can help him. What do you suggest?"

- Well Claire, the best thing you can do is to significantly lower your self-esteem, get a heap of plastic surgery and try and compete with these porn stars.
- Because the best way you can help him is by fueling his addiction and exacerbating it, so that when he hits rock bottom, you'll be there to help him back up. And he'll be really grateful for that.
- Jerking him while he watches porn is also really helpful.
- But seriously speaking if you want to help him, is to donate all your life savings to NeverFap Deluxe. All proceeds go towards helping the less fortunate, but also I'm dying to build a new pool, so that would absolutely fantastic.

What Does It Mean To Be Addicted To Porn?

- This is a personal question, only you can decide.
- I personally would describe addiction as when you feel as if you have no choice in doing something.
- I don't care if it's once a week, or once a month - if you feel as if you cannot live without that feeling, then it's an addiction.
- And the hard thing is that you don't realise this until after you overcome your addiction.
- In my case, I guess addiction meant not being able to control myself.
- And recovery to me means having control over my mind.

"Hey Julius. I'm addicted to gay porn. Does that make me gay?"

- Watching gay porn is possibly one of the gayest anyone can do.
- Watching gay porn is gayer than taking a cock, while vomitting on another cock because you're in the middle of a cock sandwich.
- Watching gay porn is gayer than blowing a guy at a gay club, which he tickles your nut sack.
- I tell ya what isn't gay though. Shooting children in a mall. That's possibly the manliest thing anyone can do, so I recommend pickin' up a gun. Killing a kid, and feeling proud of yourself.
- So that sketch was clearly advocating child murder.

Porn Addiction Is A Symptom

- Porn Addiction is a symptom. (talk about other symptoms)
- The cause is not having control over your mind. (in other words, not having your mental health in order)
- The problem is that a lot of the time we just try and address symptoms.
- Porn blockers, for example. Symptoms.
- (how do you develop control over your mind)
- At the end of the day, your mental health is King.
- God of course, an extraneous concept above King (but we don't talk about religion on the show)

- Firstly, how dare you accuse me of faking my dick pics.
- They are 100% authentic pictures of my penis.
- I even use makeup down there to make it look nice. I like a blush on my nutsack.
- I mean clearly what this means is that there are other people in the dic pic community who are pretending to be me and circulating grossly exaggerated pictures of my penis to ruin my name.
- For those at home wondering whether their dic pic is authentic, here are the key traits to look out for.
- At least 1 metre long. Anything less, and it's a fake.
- Silky yellow skin.
- Definitely not cheesy. It is as clean as a whistle.
- Perfect girth.

The Importance Of An Effective Daily Routine

- Routine is something that I have which helps me tremendously.
- For me, routine is about having to think less, and especially dealing with stress.
- Like, I get easily overwhelmed, but by sticking to my routine. NFD is an example, how there's so much I can possibly do with it.
- It's also important, because it demonstrates possibility in what people can get done in their day.
- A lot of people don't really know what to do, and so seeing what others can do helps.
- Routine is also important early in our recovery to provide perspective.
- Emotions, feelings and motivation are all things that we're battling with in the beginning.
- But your routine always stays the same, and that's a really important thing for people to realise.

- Suddenly, episodes of the big bang theory have become funny.
- Go go. gaga. I'm not a baby.
