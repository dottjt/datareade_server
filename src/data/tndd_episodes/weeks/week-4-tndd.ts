Taking Recovery One Step At A Time

- I wanted to talk about this so you could have a better understanding of how to analyse and identify our behaviours.
- The problem is that people don't know how to break things down. They get too overwhelmed with their emotions and feelings.
- A lot of this comes down to the fact that people largely have unhealthy coping mechanisms. They get overwhelmed because they haven't learnt any other strategies.
- Ultimately, taking it one step at a time is an iterative approach, and effectively describes the process of developing awareness.
- Essentially identifying behaviours and addressing them either with new behaviours or eliminating that behaviour overall.
- Mentally, this also means learnint to slow your mind down. This is in part what meditation aims to achieve.
- Slow it down buddy! And of course this ties back into learning to let go as well.

Is It Okay To Masturbate Without Porn?

- Short answer, no. It's not okay to masturbate without porn.
- Why's it not okay? Well here are some of the reasons.
  - For starters, the dopamine rush you get from masturbating is still incredibly disruptive to our aim of maintaining mental balance.
  - And a consequence of this is that masturbating for a lot of people is a huge trigger to go and then watch porn.
  - The primary reason from a recovery point of view is that masturbating does nothing to help us develop control over our mind. So effectively, it doesn't help you recover, even if it is a way to cope.

- Here's the deal. You have no requirement to masturbate, at all. It is a coping mechanism, but it is one of millions of coping mechanisms and there are better ways to cope.
- You ever tried crochet~! That shit is intense~! Murder!? Now that's a great way to relax!
- I hope that helps!

Is It Ever Okay To Relapse?

- Short answer, no. It is never okay to relapse.
- If you're thinking about relapse then it basically means that you don't have a solid mental health strategy down.
- Put simply, you are only effective as your mental health strategy.
- Recovery is not a matter of trying to wing it or thing it's about resolve, because that's the kind of bs that gets you a month, and then ends in relapse.

- Utimately what we are attempting to do is maintain mental balance.
  - When you have mental balance, you don't have urges and you don't struggle and you don't feel like you need to relapse, because you're balanced.
- How do you develop mental balance?
- Well, you do it by developing your awareness, which allows you to consciously change your behaviours.

- Of course, by all means, relapse if the alternative is you beating your wife, because it's better to cope than not cope at all.
- But in general there is no valid reason to relapse when you have other healthier coping mechanisms available to you.

"Hi Julius. You absolute beast! What's your favourite sexual position? Especially with other men."

- Reverse cowgirl is one that I invented back in the late 80s'. I was a daring pornographer seeking new ways to thrill and entertain.
- When it's with a gay, as an obvious homosexual myself, I like to punch him in the back of the head while screaming "I'm a gay man!" from the top of my lungs.
- Then I take their wallet and never call back, because a priest told me not to do it and I'm naughty!
- In general however I will admit that I'm a gentle lovers. Usually I won't have sex with you until I first meet your mother and father, as well as have sex with your siblings CAUSE THE READE IS A WHORE!?!?!

What To Expect From Life Post-Addiction

- I want you to picture a blue carrot typing frantically on a macbook pro. Now replace that image with your porn and your addiction.
- That's what it's like post-addiction. It becomes a non-thought.

- An interesting thing I've observed is that a lot of people's fear are based solely in addiction.
- For example, worried that you won't be able to experience porn again. Guess what, you won't even be thinking about porn to ever want to experience it again!

- Of course, it depends entirely on whether you continue to engage with your mental health routine. This is a lifetime commitment. There are no quick fixes.
- It doesn't matter if you're 10 days, 3 months or even 20 years since you last whacked one out, you must always be working on your mental health.
- You know when you have that regret when you relapse and you're like why did I throw this away? Well yeah, that's because you decided not to work on your mental health and everything fell apart.

"Hey Julius. I've begun masturbating in public as an alternative to masturbating to porn. Is this a normal or healthy thing to do?"

- Firstly, how dare you contribute towards the stigma that is public masturbation. Not only is it completely healthy, but it's a life skill that you will take you very far.
  - Feeling nervous during a job interview? Just wack it out and start beating it!
  - Maybe you want to impress a fine young lady walkin' down the street. BAM~! Rock out with you cock out.
- And you know if you feel uncomfortable masturbating in public, I offer group classes where we masturbate at the train station, the shopping mall, the kindergarten.
- Now on the other hand, gay sex. Now that's weird. Booo! Burn homosexuals, or whatever the bible says.

Recovery Is Not A Permanent State Of Mind

- The point of this discussion is to basically drill in a key message when it comes to recovery.
- There is no such thing as being permanently recovered. Recovery is not a switch.

- Recovery is a constant process of maintaining balance.
- The moment you lose balance is when everything falls apart and you relapse.
- This is why consistency and in particular consistent meditation is so important.
- If you're not working on your mental health, you lose it.
- That much is clear.
