Why Do You Want To Recover?

- This is purely a personal question, there is no right or wrong answer.
- But I thought I'd cover a few of the reasons, as well as my own perspective.
- For a lot of people it's to escape the suffering that is dependency and addiction.
  - Addiction of any kind is not a pleasant experience.
  - The emotion is causes. The guilt. The lying.
  - And of course with addiction, if left unchecked, it only ever gets worse.
  - In fact you don't even need to make it worse, simply by not stopping it gets worse.

- Not just personal suffering, but the suffering it causes to the people around us. Friends, family, partners.
- Of course the other side of the story is not just stopping suffering, but becoming something better.
- Being able to pursue ambition without fear or worry.

- Basically, there is no reason not to recover.
- However, you can only recover if you know how.

"Would you rather stick your dick in a black hole or a neutron star?"

- Well this is a rather technical question, but I am also a man of science. So I'm commited to this skit.
- Here's the low down buddy, my penis is actually so big and so dense that it technically is a black hole mathematically speaking.
- And I can confirm this: Women who have attempted to go down on me have literally never come back. (largely it's because I murder them, cause who wants to pay a hooker?)
- So if you were to stick a black hole into a black hole, it'd be absolute chaos. It's kinda like crossing swords at a urinal. You just don't do it. It's weird.
- Whereas if I were to stick my penis into a neurton star, I imagine that would be pretty sexy because my black hole penis would simply gobble it up.
- So I'm going to have to lock in b eddie, I'm going for the neutron star.
- (Ah, and you wonder why we don't have sponsors on the show.

Behaviours Are Everything

- This is a little spiel that I came up with. Hopefully you this neat little bit of perspective helpful.
- The initial point I want to make is that everything comes down to behaviours.
- Behaviours influence everything. Your perspective. They influence your outcomes. For example if you were to go out and eat 20 burgers aka binge, the consequence is going to be ...
- In our specific case, the behaviour we struggle with is masturbation and watching porn.

- Now the point I want to make is that more often than not we don't focus on the behaviour. We focus on the fallout.
- For example, feeling really depressed because you're no longer watching porn.
- TODO

The fallout itself i.e. pied is not the behaviour, that is just the symptom. The behaviour is the issue.
What balance does is it allows us to easily analyse and change our behaviours, which in turn affects how we think about sex etc.
Certainly, balance is not a silver bullet to changing your mind. That kind of solution doesn't exist. What it does do however, is facilitate the process so that you no longer have to struggle to change your behaviours.

"Hey Julius. Loving the face tatt. My children are lazy and unmotivated. I've tried rewarding them, getting them hooked on meth, but nothing seems to work. What should I do so I can have the A+ students that I've always dreamed of!?!"

- Well you see, you've got it all wrong. The best way to motivate children is to get them hooked on porn.
- Especially that sexy teacher roleplay, where the teacher spanks the student for being naughty and not doing their homework.
- We even have our own series of educational porn specifically for children.
- We've got math teacher roleplays, gym teacher roleplays, roleplays where the only way not to get expelled is to have sex with the principal.
- You know, these are real life skills that we're teaching children at the end of the day, which are not only appropriate, but will serve them well for many years to come.

"Hi Mr. Reade. Thank you for reading my email. Last night I got very drunk and I accidentally tattooed a picture of my girlfriend's vagina on my face. She'll know it's hers because of how big, wide and hairy it is. I'm freaking out and not quite sure what to do. Please help me Doctor Reade!?"

- Firstly, I would really just like to clarify that I am not a doctor. I mean, don't get me wrong I do perform miracles, but I definitely cannot help you with any kind of medical advice.
- I myself also have a tattoo of my girlfriend's vagina on my face, so I can relate to this situation quite vividly.
- As is the case in any healthy relationship, denial is your friend.
- Just straight up deny that you even have a tattoo of a vagina on your face. Try and make it sound as if she's in the wrong. Maybe this is an opportunity to convince her that she has a nice tight vagina.
- Worst case scenario just deny that you're even in a relationship with her. That unfortunately didn't work for me, but perhaps you'll have a better chance!
- Of course the ideal solution is that she would simply get a picture of your dick on her face, except it would be so small no one would be able to see it! AYEEOOOOO.
