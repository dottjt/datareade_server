Why Is Recovery Important To You?

- This is a personal question obviously, that only you can answer.
- Maybe you're interested in self-improving. (becoming a better person out of principle)
- Recovery is important for me for a number of reasons.
- As someone who has mental health issues, addiction exacerbates that tremendously.
- Recovery is important simply so I can function in society.
- I think you don't realise how important recovery is until you recover. You don't realise the extent to which it was impacting you, until you overcome it.
- (talk about the desperation in porn addiction, going to the library to masturbate during work)
- Imagine how your life would be different if you were recovered?
- Of course, while I can tell you how it's important to me, only you can decide for yourself whether you want to commit to recovery or not.

Why PMO Streaks Don't Matter

- Let's start with the fundamentals.
- Recovery is about mental health. (elaborate on practice, balance, )
- Streaks are just arbitrary numbers. They do nothing for your mental health.
- Streaks don't improve on developing control over your mind, and becoming a better person
- What's the alternative? Actually focus on your mental health.
- It's the difference between reading about weight lifting and obsessing about it, and actually weight lifting.
- In addition, streaks don't prove anything.
- You can get 1 month, but if you're really struggling throughout it, then are you actually recovering?

- Well, lube is obviously very important to maintaining sexy legs.
- Now that I'm no longer masturbating, I like to slather it on.

Discovering Purpose During Recovery

- An interesting thing you'll notice during recovery (or perhaps have noticed) is that your purpose will change over time.
- Usually in response to your progress, and in particular the difficulty of recovery.
- In the beginning it's usually about self-improvement.
- Later on the though when you're really, really struggling you realise it's much, much more than self-improvement.
- It is now a genunie problem that you didn't realise the extent to which was a problem.
- One thing I'll say is that purpose should not be the focus.
- Process and commitment should always be the focus. Because those things never change. Purpose does.
- With that said, having a sense of purpose can help mid-term, aligning you with your goals.
- In my case, my purpose is to simply to be the best person that I can be at all times. (health, career, you name it)

"Hello Mr. Reade. I'm a huge fan of the show. I can't stop masturbating to pictures of my mother. What should I do?"

- Well Riley, incest is quite serious, so I recommend steering clear.
- The sensible thing to do would be to have sex with your mother. That way, you can understand why it's wrong.
- I personally creampie my mother once a month, just to remind myself that it's really not okay.
- aaaand I can't believe I just said that, this is officially the episode. Because I'm going to go kill myself now.

How Does Masturbation Make You Feel?

- I think there's two sides to it.
- Physically speaking, obviously masturbation feels good.
- As an addiction however, there are other feelings associated. For example, you may feel guilt and shame about your behaviour.
- And it can become a self-reinforcing cycle.
- Of course, what people don't realise is that it really matter how masturbation makes you feel.
- One thing you learn during recovery is that the process is above all.
- How you feel is just a symptom. It's not the cause. The cause is not having mental balance.
- And what people don't realise, is that our feelings go both ways and regardless of how you feel, it's not relevant.
- It doesn't matter if yuo're feeling awful or if you're feeling amazing. It's simply not relevant to your recovery, because recovery is about process. Not feelings.

- It's a known fact that women love to be spat on. That's a fact.
- Women also like a sensitive guy, so you know, standing outside her house behind the bushes and staring at her hours, will make her WET. WET I tell ya.
- Bragging about penis size and how fast your car is, also incredibly important.
- Above all though, women absolutely love an undying porn addict. There's absolutely nothing sexier than another guy masturbating to someone who's not you.

Why Mental Health Is The Foundation Of Any Recovery

- Mental health is everything.
- There's no point living if you're unhappy or don't have control over your mind (elaborate)
- It's the basis for having control over your mind. Mental health is what allows you control.
- This is why recovery is solely about getting your mental health in order.
- And that's why I talk about things like HCM and UCM, because those things directly impact your mental health.
- (distraction etc.)
- What does this mean? It means practicing awareness and mental health exercises.
- (I like to describe it as a routine of mental health)

- But the main thing with being weird, unlike myself, is to sexualise it.
- Jump on the webcam. Touch the third nipple. I know I'd be down for that. Maybe send me an email, and I'll see what I can do.
