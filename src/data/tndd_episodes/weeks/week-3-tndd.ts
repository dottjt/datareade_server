How Much Does Your Porn Addiction Cost You?

- Cost is obviously a very subjective thing. But there are several costs to consider.
  - Cost on your physical health and mental health (explain)
  - Actual monetary cost is huge. Billions are spent every year on porn
  - Let alone the time cost.
- In other words, how much will you save not being addicted.
- At the end of the day, everything comes at a cost (talk about coping mechanisms)

Landon Morgan from Damascus, Syria.

"Hey Julius. Loving tonight show. Although I'm allergic to gay sex, I can't stop blowing other dudes. What do you think I should do?"

- I think you should just keep blowing guys. Everyone knows that it's good for your teeth. Gettin' a bit of dick going on there.
- In my experience, you have to have sex with at least 50 other guys to confirm that you're 100% allergic. Double penetration obviously speeds up that process tremendously.
- Although I will say, as someone who's name is Landon, you're most definitely not allergic to gay sex. That is the gayest name I've ever heard.
- Although if you are truly allergic, then there is one way out. Unfortunately, it looks like you may have to kill yourself.
- I know it's a hard realisation to come to, but suicide is actually not the cowards way out. (Do it. Do it. DO IT!)

- This is just a casual topic.
- What is it you want from life?
  + Become famous
  + Become a good person.
  + Maybe you have a visual idea (a family, children, a house)
  + Maybe you're in it for the learning and the experience of life.
- Irrespective of who you want to become, it's not possible if you don't have control over your mind.
- The way you do that is by having good mental health.
- Furthermore, if you're not truly present with life, are you actually living it at all.

- Firstly, how can you even confuse your holes. They're two very different holes.
- There's the poo hole, then there's the pleasure hole.
- There's also a third hole which is a gun wound where my dad shot me as a child, I like to finger that on occassion. Get on the webcam. Touch it sensually while crying under the trauma.
- There's also that other hole where food goes into. You know, your butt hole.
- So shame on you. For being retarded. (just casually disability shamed there)
- As for helping you, absolutely not. (whisper: I'll come down later in my gimp outfit, and we'll have a good time)

- Hard answer, it depends.
- For most it doesn't, because they approach it in the wrong way.
- Basically, people who pursue unhealthy coping mechanisms get nowhere.
  + distraction
  + escapism
  + judgement.
- These things do not improve clarity or awareness, therefore do not allow you to consciously change your behaviours.
- Recovery does get easier however if you focus on your mental health.
- This means meditating daily.
- Working on identifying unhealthy behaviours and changing them.

- Absolutely not, you should definitely rape that sausage.
- Sausages really are the sluts of the meat world, so it's important that you treat them as such.
- I personally like to spit on my sausage before I absolutely devour it.
- And I want to make it clear, under no circumstances is it actually okay to eat the sausage. That is far too civil. You're doing the sausage a HUGE disfavour.
- In all seriousness though, you should rape your sausage in front of a starving african child, just so that sausage knows that it couldn't even nourish those who need it most.

What Do You Struggle With Most About Your Recovery?

- This is an important thing for you to think about.
- In fact, this is basically the process of recovery - constant iteration.
- What a lot of people do is they focus on the symptoms - they specify the type of porn they struggle with for example, or like how can I distract myself from my urges.
- What they don't realise is that all their struggle comes down to a failure of awareness.
- The only reason why you relapse or have urges, is because you didn't hae the awareness to catch the behaviours which lead to those outcomes.
- Identifying struggle is ultimately about identifying how you can be more aware throughout your day.

- Maybe you're not even actually her son. Maybe you're adopted? I mean, have you noticed how you have black skin and your mother has white skin?!?!
- Maybe it's because all you're only 12 years old and all you do is take, take, take. When was the last time you had to work in an office 8 hours a day and actually earn some money!
- Are you an A+ student!?!! Clearly not, because fact is, no one loves you and should definitely run away from home and possibly drown yourself in a lake where no one will ever find you.

The Fallacy Of Sheer Willpower

- Willpower is a misconception based on this idea of struggle.
- Why? Because those starting out literally know nothing but struggle, so they falsely assume that struggle itself is the process.
- It's like saying, I'm no longer addicted to cigarettes, but I now really hate my life and everythign is awful! Can you successfully say you've recovered in that scenario?
- Truth is, you're not recovering if you're struggling.
- You're only recovering once you're learning to eliminate that struggle, and you don't do that by smashing your head against a brick wall.
- You do it by developing self-control, which comes from awareness and more importantly, letting go.
- And the way you do this is by developing your awareness. AKA meditation.
